I am a Project Manager in the research and development division of [JSC Electron](http://www.electronxray.com) in [Saint Petersburg](http://www.saint-petersburg.com). 
Here I have been leading a suite of projects to introduce new medical imaging modalities nuclear medicine ([SPECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography)), CT and diagnostic ultra sound.
I've navigated the project from inception phase through all the reefs and flats of entire project livecycle and finally managed to get moored at assembly bay (building this is was one of sub-projects).            
Beyound that I hold a position of a visiting Nuclear Medicine Technologist in [Saint Petersburg City Oncology Clinic](http://oncology.spb.ru/st.-petersburg-city-oncology-clinic.html).
I have previously spent over than 10 years in software engineering,  
giving me a good blend of enterprise and start-up experience.  
I enjoy creating new products with great user experiences and working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation and shipping small, frequent releases. 
I'm keen to new technologies and able to grasp them fast, albeit I sometimes prefer being conservative and use old good stuff. 
I feel comfortable working in multicultural, distributed environments.
