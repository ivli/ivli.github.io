I am a Project Manager working for JSC Electron, having previously spent over 10 years at software engineering positions, giving me a good blend of enterprise and start-up experience. I enjoy creating new products with great user experiences and working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation and shipping small, frequent releases. 
I am keen to new technologies albeit often prefer being conservative. I feel comfortable working in multicultural and distributed environments, on the edge of the technology.
