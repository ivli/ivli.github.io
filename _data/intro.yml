I am a Project Manager in the research and development division of [JSC Electron](http://www.electronxray.com) in [Saint Petersburg](http://www.saint-petersburg.com). Here I lead design and construction nuclear medicine domograph ([SPECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography)). Also I am a part time Nuclear Medicine Technologist in [Saint Petersburg State Oncology Hospital](http://oncology.spb.ru).
I have previously spent over than 10 years at software engineering, giving me a good blend of enterprise and start-up experience. I enjoy creating new products with great user experiences and working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation and shipping small, frequent releases. 
I'm keen to new technologies albeit sometimes prefer being conservative using old good stuff. Feeling myself comfortable working in multicultural, distributed environments, on the front edge.
