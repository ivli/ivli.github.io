I am a Project Manager in the research and development division of [JSC Electron](http://www.electronxray.com) in [Saint Petersburg](http://www.saint-petersburg.com). Here I lead design and construction nuclear medicine domograph ([SPECT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography)). Also I am a part time Nuclear Medicine Technologist in [Saint Petersburg City Oncology Clinic](http://oncology.spb.ru/st.-petersburg-city-oncology-clinic.html).
I have previously spent over than 10 years at software engineering, giving me a good blend of enterprise and start-up experience. I enjoy creating new products with great user experiences and working in a dynamic environment with a focus on good development practices, automation and shipping small, frequent releases. 
I'm keen to new technologies albeit sometimes prefer being conservative using old good stuff. I feel comfortable working in multicultural, distributed environments, on the front edge.
